  The dataset I chose depicted the plastic pollution found in countries across the world by volunteers who aimed to clean up the pollution. The data collection on plastic pollution in various countries was conducted in 2019 and 2020 and tells the country of origin in which the plastic was collected. The dataset includes various subcategories of plastic pollution collected as well as a grand total variable, which is the total number of plastics collected including all 7 types of plastic. 
  After reading in the dataset, I did a command to view a 6 x 14 table of the data, in order to see what the data points looked like. I then created a bar chart that depicted each country and how much plastic each country collected. I faceted the bar chart by year to determine if the amount of plastic collected changed. In the next visualization I created a scatter plot that depicted the countries in which the plastic was collected and the amount of plastic they found. In this visualization I wanted to see if there were any outliers in each country for the total amount of plastic that was collected per plastic collection event. In each county, some plastic pollution clean up events yielded a larger collection of plastic compared to others. In the final visualization I developed a line graph to show the plastic collection by different countries from 2019 to 2020. I wanted to do a line graph to visually demonstrated if there was an increase or a decrease in the amount of plastic collected.
